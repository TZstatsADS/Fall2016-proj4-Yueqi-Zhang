+ Projec title: Features and Lyrics Analysis
+ Project summary: The main prupose of this project is to explore connection between lyrics and features. Based on this goal, I complete this project by two main part. The first one is to recommend lyrics to a new song, or rather, which words have a relatively higher showing up probability. The second part is to explore association pattern between features and songs by association rules.
